# MorganHacks2024
This is our implementation for a career path planner to help anyone get from point A to point B.  
Uses a Machine learning algorithm to match your current skill set to those on the market in order to find you the easiest pivot for your career.

# How we built it
This was built using Django. We scripted a machine learning algorithm utilizing sklearn to match skills to new jobs that align with your skills. Then we hosted A frontend using streamlet and tally.co for the website and form.

# Challenges we ran into
This project pushed us to our limits. We had to learn web hosting, machine learning, and getting data efficiently. The machine learning algorithm especially gave us trouble, getting our data in the correct format and increasing accuracy of output.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
In the end we ended with a working algorithm and a spectacular-looking website, we are proud of that.

# What we learned
Various technologies including: Django sklearn Streamlit ngrok tally.co

# What's next for Pivot
Our goal is to expand this app to encompass Job to Job support and we want to generate resources for users to click on so they can get a better idea of the skills they need to learn.
